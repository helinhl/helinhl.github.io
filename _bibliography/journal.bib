  abstract={Fast Internet-wide scanning is essential for network situational awareness and asset evaluation. However, the vast IPv6 address space makes brute-force scanning infeasible. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art methods, they do not work in seedless regions and suffer low detection efficiency and speed in regions with seed addresses. Moreover, the collected active address list (i.e., IPv6 hitlist) with low coverage cannot truly represent the active IPv6 address landscape of the Internet. This paper introduces AddrMiner, a fast, efficient, and comprehensive global active IPv6 address detection system. We design a systematic active IPv6 address detection strategy that divides the IPv6 space into two detection scenarios based on the presence or absence of seed addresses to discover active IPv6 addresses from scratch and from few to many. In the seedless regions, we present AddrMiner-N, leveraging a multi-level association policy to probe active addresses. It fills the gap of address detection in seedless regions and successfully discovers active addresses in 39,899 BGP prefixes without seed addresses, with a 1.03X higher hit rate, 30∼911X higher speed, and 2.7X broader coverage, compared to existing solutions. In the regions with seed addresses, our method AddrMiner-S dynamically generates target addresses using reinforcement learning. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AddrMiner-S achieves an impressive 56.3% hit rate and a discovery speed of 839.0/s, which is 1.9∼2153X and 1.5∼755X of existing works, respectively. Finally, we deploy AddrMiner and discover 2.1B active IPv6 addresses, including 1.7B de-aliased active addresses and 0.4B aliased addresses, through continuous probing for three years.},

  abstract={Internet-wide scanning is a commonly used research technique in various network surveys, such as measuring service deployment and security vulnerabilities. However, these network surveys are limited to the given port set, not comprehensively obtaining the real network landscape, and even misleading survey conclusions. In this work, we introduce PMap, a port scanning tool that efficiently discovers the most open ports from all 65K ports in the whole network. PMapuses the correlation of ports to build an open port correlation graph of each network, using a reinforcement learning framework to update the correlation graph based on feedback results and dynamically adjust the order of port scanning. Compared to current port scanning methods, PMapperforms better on hit rate, coverage, and intrusiveness. Our experiments over real networks show that PMapcan find 90% open ports by only scanning 125 ports (90%@125) to each address, which is 99.3% less than the state-of-the-art port scanning methods. It reduces the number of scanned ports to decrease the intrusive nature of port scanning. In addition, PMapis highly parallel and lightweight. It scans 500 networks in parallel, achieving a port recommendation rate of up to 18 million per second, consuming only 7GB of memory. PMapis the first effective practice for scanning open ports using reinforcement learning. It bridges the gap of existing scanning tools and effectively supports subsequent service discovery and security research.},

  abstract={With the desired functionality of moving object tracking, wireless pan-tilt cameras are able to play critical roles in a growing diversity of surveillance environments. However, today's pan-tilt cameras oftentimes underperform when tracking frequently moving objects like humans – they are prone to lose sight of objects and bring about excessive mechanical rotations that are especially detrimental to those energy-constrained outdoor scenarios. The ineffectiveness and high cost of all state-of-the-art tracking approaches are rooted in their adherence to the industry's simplicity principle, which leads to their stateless nature, performing gimbal rotations based only on the latest object detection. To address the issues, we design and implement WiseCam that wisely tunes the pan-tilt cameras to minimize mechanical rotation costs while maintaining long-term object tracking. This systematic tracking approach also tackles issues of motion-rotation speed gap and scattered moving objects, which is universally applicable to complex tracking scenarios. We examine the performance of WiseCam by experiments on two types of pan-tilt cameras with different motors. Results show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art tracking approaches on both tracking duration and power consumption.},

  abstract={IoT devices bring great convenience to a person’s life and industrial production. However, their rapid proliferation also troubles device management and network security. Network administrators usually need to know how many IoT devices are in the network and whether they behave normally. IoT device identification is the first step to achieving these goals. Previous IoT device identification methods reach high accuracy in a closed environment. But they are not applicable in the continuously changing environment. When new types of devices are plugged in, they cannot update themselves automatically. Besides, they usually rely on supervised learning and need lots of labeled data, which is costly. To solve these problems, we propose a novel IoT device identification model named AutoIoT, updating itself automatically when new types of devices are plugged in. Besides, it only needs a few labeled data and identifies IoT devices with high accuracy. The evaluation on two public datasets shows that AutoIoT can identify new device types only using 1.5∼2.5 hours’ traffic and still have high accuracy after updating. Moreover, it has a better performance than other works when there are only a few labeled data, especially in an environment with scanning traffic.},

  abstract={IP spoofing is prevalently used for anonymity and reflection attacks, e.g., distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which have shown increasingly destructive power in recent years because today's Internet lacks validation on source addresses. Moreover, the fast deployment of IPv6 on the Internet may further aggravate the damages of DDoS attacks.

    This paper proposes a novel source address validation mechanism called SAV6, which leverages the huge IPv6 address space to validate source addresses at an inter-autonomous system (AS) granularity. In SAV6, each IPv6 address contains an AS number (ASN), whose corresponding AS announces the prefix of the address to other ASes. An AS can determine the authenticity of the source address by whether the ASN in the address matches the corresponding prefix after receiving an incoming packet. The performance evaluation of a SAV6 prototype shows that it adds little performance overhead to the deployed infrastructures and is a lightweight and deployable protocol.},

  abstract={Computing power network connects computing nodes through the network to break the limitation of single point of computing power, and it is rapidly developed and applied in more and more business fields in recent years. The popular live video broadcasting relies on the transmission and transcoding of a large number of video frames, and it is of great practical importance to explore computing power networks for efficient video distribution. Compared with the traditional large-scale data processing, video applications have higher requirements for transmission delay and bandwidth guarantee. However, the computing power of nodes provided by each cloud service varies, and the state of network links between nodes often varies. Therefore, it is a great challenge to realize low latency and high bandwidth video distribution by selecting nodes with the best combined transmission and transcoding performance. Therefore, we design an efficient video distribution scheme based on heterogeneous computing nodes, including planning video transmission paths and reasonably selecting transcoding nodes through reinforcement learning, using priority queuing scheduling for different video distribution tasks and adaptively adjusting node resources to reduce resource bursty competition, adopting a layered-log-synchronization fault tolerance mechanism to quickly restore data consistency after node failures, and finally deploying multi-cloud service distributed nodes to realize a complete video distribution system. A large number of live ultra-high definition video experiments show that the performance of this scheme is significantly improved compared with existing video distribution methods.},

  abstract={Fast IPv4 scanning significantly improves network measurement and security research. Nevertheless, it is infeasible to perform brute-force scanning of the IPv6 address space. Alternatively, one can find active IPv6 addresses through scanning the candidate addresses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the probing efficiency of such algorithms is often very low. In this paper, our objective is to improve the probing efficiency of IPv6 addresses. We first perform a longitudinal active measurement study and build a high-quality dataset, hitlist, including more than 1.95,B IPv6 addresses distributed in 58.2,K BGP prefixes and collected over 17 months period. Different from the previous works, we probe the announced BGP prefixes using a pattern-based algorithm. This results in a dataset without uneven address distribution and low active rates. Further, we propose an efficient address generation algorithm, DET, which builds a density space tree to learn high-density address regions of the seed addresses with linear time complexity and improves the active addresses' probing efficiency. We then compare our algorithm DET against state-of-the-art algorithms on the public hitlist and our hitlist by scanning 50,M addresses. Our analysis shows that DET increases the de-aliased active address ratio and active address (including aliased addresses) ratio by 10\%, and 14\%, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a fingerprint-based method to detect aliased prefixes. The proposed method for the first time directly verifies whether the prefix is aliased or not. Our method finds that 10.64\% of the public aliased prefixes are false positive.},

  abstract={Faithfully emulating networks is critical for verifying the correctness and effectiveness of new networking-related designs. Existing network experiment platforms either cannot faithfully emulate the functionality and performance of production networks or cannot scale well due to cost constraints. In this paper, we propose TurboNet, a new network emulator that utilizes one or more programmable switches to achieve faithful emulation of the network data plane and control plane. For data plane emulation, we propose a series of key designs, such as port mapper, queue mapper, and delayed queue, to emulate network topologies and performance metrics with high flexibility and accuracy. For control plane emulation, we support static routing configurations, distributed routing agents, and the centralized routing controllers. Meanwhile, we provide APIs for operators to simplify network emulation tasks. We implement TurboNet on Tofino switches. Evaluation results show that: (1) On the data plane, TurboNet can flexibly emulate various topologies, such as an 8-ary fat-tree with only one programmable switch and a 10-ary fat-tree with four programmable switches; (2) On the control plane, TurboNet supports about 200 BGP agents on a single programmable switch with a CPU usage of 25\%; (3) TurboNet can accurately emulate different network performance metrics such as 10⁻⁸ link loss, and microsecond to millisecond link delay.},

Stateful packet filter is an integral DCN component of ensuring connection security for BMS. However, the off-the-shelf stateful packet filters either are costly for cloud DCNs or introduce significant performance bottlenecks. In this article, we present CoFilter , which leverages low-cost programmable switches to accelerate the stateful packet filter for BMS. CoFilter uses (1) stateful process partition to enable complex stateful packet filtering logic on programmability-limited switching ASICs, (2) state compression to track tens of millions of connections with constrained hardware memory, and (3) per-tenant packet rate limit and tenant-aware flow migration to achieve efficient performance isolation among different tenants. Overall, CoFilter implements a high-performance stateful packet filter via the co-design of programmable switching ASIC and CPU. We evaluate CoFilter under various data center traffic traces with real-world flow distributions. The evaluation results show that CoFilter remarkably outperforms NetFilter, i.e., forwarding packets at line rate (13x throughput of NetFilter), keeping packet delay within 1us, and freeing a significant quantity of CPU cores, with rather small memory usage, i.e., accommodating over 107 connections with only 16MB SRAM.},

IoT device identification in open environments is the key to its application in real environments, where IoT and non-IoT device identification is the first and critical step.

This paper presents EvoIoT, an IoT and non-IoT identification model designed to apply in open environments with high scalability and the ability to run sustainably and effectively. EvoIoT achieves high scalability by applying a unified model for all devices. To mine discriminative features from encrypted traffic, EvoIoT extracts original features from packet headers and judges feature importance in the entire model update process. For sustainability, EvoIoT proposes a representative device choosing method and model update method to address the concept drift caused by new types of devices. EvoIoT is the first high-performance model that systematically addresses the IoT and non-IoT device classification problem. We evaluate EvoIoT on two public datasets and a private dataset collected from a laboratory setting.

Therefore, it is not easy to provide truly fine-grained traffic operations for applications and guarantee their corresponding service level agreement requirements. In this article, we propose ATE6, which is an application-aware traffic engineering (TE) framework. For the control plane, we define a request language that can be used by applications to express their requirements, which allows networks to associate IPv6 addresses with the communication requirements of applications. We also devise an efficient path selection algorithm that allows the network operator to deploy an optimal TE path for an application. For the data plane, ATE6 uses segment routing over the IPv6 data plane to enforce and control network paths based on network policies. We implemented a prototype, and evaluation results show that ATE6 is a flexible, privacy-preserving, lightweight, and cost-efficient application-aware TE framework.},

  abstract={Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is one of the functions of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), which determines whether the IPv6 address of a node conflicts with those of other nodes. However, due to the lack of verification of NDP messages, DAD is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Existing solutions suffer from high complexity and low security, need to modify the NDP, or have a single point of failure, which renders them infeasible to be deployed.

To solve the above problems, we propose P4DAD, which is a secure DAD mechanism based on P4. By creating and maintaining a binding entry between an IPv6 address and a link-layer property of a host’s network attachment, P4DAD can filter spoofed NDP messages in an in-network manner to prevent DoS attacks on DAD without modification to the NDP or host stack. We implement a prototype of P4DAD and evaluate it in terms of functionality, performance, and scalability. Evaluation results show that P4DAD can prevent DoS attacks on DAD successfully with negligible overhead and has satisfactory scalability.},

Although Source Address Validations (SAVs) at the access network level are standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), SAV at the inter-Autonomous System (AS) level still remains an important issue. To prevent routing hijacking, the IETF is constructing a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) as a united trust anchor to secure interdomain routing. In this study, we creatively use the RPKI to support inter-AS SAV and propose an RPKI-based Inter-AS Source Protection (RISP) mechanism. According to the trust basis provided by the RPKI, RISP offers ASes a more credible source-oriented protection for the IP addresses they own and remains independent of the RPKI. Based on the experiments with real Internet topology, RISP not only provides better incentives, but also improves efficacy and economizes bandwidth with a modest resource consumption.},
