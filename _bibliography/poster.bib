    abstract={The rapid expansion of the IPv6 Internet highlights the critical need for advanced topology mapping to enhance network management and security. However, the large address space and stringent ICMP rate limiting pose significant challenges for IPv6 topology discovery. To this end, we introduce TopoHunter, an efficient IPv6 Internet topology discovery system. The central concept of TopoHunter is to allocate more probing resources to target prefix spaces that yield greater topological benefits, as well as to their surrounding areas. To achieve this, we design a feedback-based target generation module comprised of a Target Prefix Probing Value Forest that maintains the estimated probing values of hierarchical target prefix spaces. This approach efficiently addresses the inefficiencies of existing probing methods by reducing redundancy and maximizing topological gains from each vantage point. Our system has successfully discovered the most extensive and complete IPv6 topology map to date, comprising over 144 million router interfaces and 251 million edges, covering 72.83% of autonomous systems and 43.36% of routing prefixes announced by the BGP system.},

    abstract={Target generation is a crucial step for efficient Internet-wide IPv6 scanning, yet existing techniques are hindered by limited pattern discovery and biased target distribution. We introduce RGen, a novel target generation algorithm employing real-time pattern mining and a stochastic generation strategy. RGen minimizes pattern loss, dynamically incorporates new addresses, and promotes balanced target distribution, overcoming prior limitations. Experiments show RGen achieves the highest overall hit rate (58%), surpassing the previous best (AddrMiner-S) by 60%, while simultaneously leading in network discovery, finding the most new BGP prefixes and new /64 prefixes.},
